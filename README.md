# ApeGate — Pay anywhere. Enter instantly. 🚀

ApeGate is a hackathon demo that accepts payment on Ethereum Sepolia and mints a Ticket NFT on ApeChain Curtis using Espresso finality + Presto + Hyperlane.

See the setup and demo steps in `README_SETUP.md` for deployment, running the Hyperlane validator/relayer, and launching the frontend.

Highlights:
- Espresso-confirmed state via Caff Nodes (not waiting for L1 finality) ✅
- Real cross-chain messaging via Hyperlane Mailbox + ISM
- Real NFT minted on ApeChain (ERC-721)
