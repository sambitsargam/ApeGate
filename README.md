# ApeGate — Pay anywhere. Enter instantly. 🚀

ApeGate is a hackathon demo that accepts payment on a local Anvil testnet (source) and mints a Ticket NFT on ApeChain Gary testnet (destination) using Espresso finality + Presto + Hyperlane.

See the setup and demo steps in `README_SETUP.md` for deployment, running the Hyperlane validator/relayer, and launching the frontend.

Highlights:
- Local Anvil for source chain (fast, no faucet needed) ✅
- Espresso-confirmed state via Caff Nodes (not waiting for L1 finality) ✅
- Real cross-chain messaging via Hyperlane Mailbox + ISM
- Real NFT minted on ApeChain (ERC-721)
